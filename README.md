fcc_auction
===========

This is a solution checker for the FCC Auction question on HW2 of CMU's Grad AI 2013.

*  Auctions are generated by the Python script in data_gen/.

*  The exact instances used in HW2 can be generated by the Bash script in data_gen/.

*  code/ contains C++ files (and a Makefile, tested on Ubuntu 10.04 and Mac OS X) that load auction files generated using our generator, writes their associated IP to an .lp file, and solves the IP using CPLEX.


Note
====
This is my (i.e., the TA's) solution to the problem.  By no means is it the only solution or the best solution!


External Dependencies
=====================
You'll need the following installed on your system:

*  IBM ILOG CPLEX:

   <http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/>

   You'll also need to change three environmental variables (SYSTEM, CPLEXDIR, CONCERTDIR) in the Makefile to reflect the absolute paths to the ILOG suite on your system.

   Note that any IP solver could be hooked into this code (by changing AuctionCPLEXMIP::solve_with_cplex()).  The solver needs to be able to read the .lp file format.
